# pyAirthings
Python library for the [Airthings Consumer API](https://consumer-api-doc.airthings.com/).

Create an API client at https://dashboard.airthings.com/integrations/api-integration and use its id and secret:

```python
import aiohttp
from airthings import Airthings

async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    airthings = Airthings(client_id, secret, session)
    devices = await airthings.update_devices()
```

`update_devices()` returns every device on the account, keyed by serial number, with the latest sensor values.

Example usage in Home Assistant:
